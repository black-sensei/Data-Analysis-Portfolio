# Stephen-Audu Data-Analysis-Portfolio
**About me **
Hi, I'm Stephen! 
I have an educational background in Computer Science and a professional background in data analysis for public health. I have developed a strong foundation in the HIV/AIDS program/movement and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as a data specialist/analyst.

Over the years, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management teahcniqes, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
